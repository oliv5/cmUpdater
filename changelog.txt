v0.1:

-Initial release

v0.2:

-Added function to check if update-files are already present in the specified directory

-Implemented MD5 checksums for the updates

v0.3:

-Added restore-option for backups

-Completely changed the way functions are called (used to be a chain where all functions called other functions, now it's a menu). This also allows for much simpler implementation of new features and changes in the future.

-Deleted the cmDownloader-project and implemented all features into this one

v0.4

-Added function to remove old updates due to them piling up over time if not removed manually.

v0.41

-Functions are now only called if your device is properly connected for faster launching of the script

-Added some more comments
